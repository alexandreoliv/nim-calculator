<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About the project

Nim is a mathematical game of strategy. If you're playing against someone who KNOWS how to win, chances are that you're always going to lose â€” unless you learn how the game works. This app helps you in the learning process, showing whether you're in a winning or losing situation with the current table configuration. This way, you can make sure you're on the right track, preventing your opponent from outsmarting you.

There's no fancy design here - the purpose is to be didactic only.
